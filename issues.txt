Allegro Video Capture Issues
----------------------------

[ ]Implement audio capture.

   [ ]Set a mixer post-process callback and start the audio capture pass when
      the callback is called the first time.

[ ]Finish implementing avc_encode_video().

   [ ]Current implementation is a placeholder. Need to get mencoder installed
      and get the options right.

[ ]Create example programs.

   [ ]Example programs should let user mess around a bit and replay their
      actions with a keypress. A separate keypress should replay their actions
      and record a video using AVC.

   [ ]Probably need one example with audio and one without.

[ ]Don't capture audio if audio add-on is not initialized.

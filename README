Allegro Video Capture
---------------------

A video capture module for Allegro.


Description
-----------

Allegro Video Capture (AVC) is a small drop-in module for your Allegro programs
that makes it easy to capture video without the need for external capture
programs.

AVC was created by TÂ³ Software to streamline the creation of promotional videos
for our new releases. Capturing video with external programs is cumbersome and
the results are less than ideal unless the capture is performed on high-end
hardware. We do our development on older and lower end hardware and would
rather not invest in new hardware unnecessarily.


How to Use AVC
--------------

AVC requires you to write your program in such a way that the logic will be
identical each time it is run. Provided this is the case, you simply call:

    bool avc_start_capture(ALLEGRO_DISPLAY * display,
        const char * out_filename,
        bool (*init_proc)(void * data),
        bool (*logic_proc)(void * data),
        void (*render_proc)(void * data),
        int fps,
        int flags,
        void * data);

Here is a rundown of the arguments:

    display:

        Your program's ALLEGRO_DISPLAY. The dimensions of the display determine
        the dimensions of the outputted video file.

    out_filename:

        The name the outputted video file will be saved as.

    init_proc:

        This function will be called before each video rendering pass to set
        things up for the logic to run. This function should set up all your
        program's variables so that your logic will be identical on each run
        through.

        If init_proc() returns false, the capture process will not continue.

    logic_proc:

        Your program's logic function. For each pass of the capture,
        logic_proc() will be called until it returns false.

    render_proc:

        Your program's render function. During the video capture pass, each
        logic frame will produce an image using render_proc().

    fps:

        How many frames per second your program runs at.

    flags:

        Pass 0 for now as there are no flags. Maybe in a future version.

    data:

        Your program's data. This is passed back into init_proc(),
        logic_proc(), and render_proc() on each call.

AVC assumes your render_proc() does not change the target bitmap without
restoring its previous state. This is most convenient if you are allowing
Allegro to render to its default target. You can still render things to bitmaps
for effects and such as long as you restore ALLEGRO_STATE_TARGET_BITMAP when
you're done.

If you are going to change the target bitmap you _must_ store
ALLEGRO_STATE_TARGET_BITMAP before you do and restore it _before_ rendering to
the backbuffer. AVC sets the target to a temporary bitmap and it needs your
render_proc() to render to that in order to capture the video.
